    <h1>Understanding JavaScript Call Stack</h1>
    <p>The call stack is a mechanism that JavaScript uses to keep track of function calls. It operates in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner, meaning the last function that was called is the first one to be executed.</p>
    <p>When a function is called, it is added to the top of the stack. When the function completes, it is removed from the stack, and control returns to the previous function.</p>
